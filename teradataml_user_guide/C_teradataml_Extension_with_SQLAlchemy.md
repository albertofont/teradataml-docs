# Appendix C: teradataml Extension with SQLAlchemy

Teradata Vantage offers various SQL functions that allow a user to process data. This section describes how
these common SQL functions can be used in teradataml with the help of SQLAlchemy.
You do not need to have thorough knowledge of SQLAlchemy to use the SQLAlchemy extension to
teradataml. Refer to the examples provided in the demo notebooks which are part of the teradataml
package. These demo notebooks can be found at pkg_install_location/teradataml/data/notebooks
```python
/sqlalchemy/.
```
Note:
```python
teradataml 17.20.00.xx versions only support SQLAlchemy 1.4,
```
SQLAlchemy 2.0 is not yet supported.
* Accessing Vantage SQL Functions
* Using SQLAlchemy Clause Element and Expression
## Accessing Vantage SQL Functions
teradataml supports SQL functions with the SQLAlchemy extension. For lists of these functions, see
Supported SQL Functions.
To access these functions in teradataml, you only need to know the following SQLAlchemy statement, the
rest of the functionality is managed by teradataml and Vantage.
```python
from sqlalchemy import func
```
You can use this imported func module to call Vantage SQL functions and pass those to DataFrame.assign()
function to process the data.
For more details about these functions, refer to SQL Functions, Expressions, and Predicates, B035-1145.
* Example: Accessing Vantage SQL Function with SQLAlchemy
* Supported SQL Functions
### Example: Accessing Vantage SQL Function with SQLAlchemy
In this example, you calculate the standard average of column 'gpa' and 'admitted' of the
"admissions_trains" dataset using the avg/average/ave function in Vantage.
The avg/average/ave function has the following syntax, and returns the arithmetic average of all values
in value_expression.
```python
Avg(value_expression)
```
* Create connection to Vantage and load example dataset.
```python
# Get the connection to the Vantage using create_context()
>>> from teradataml import *
>>>td_context = create_context(host=getpass.getpass("Hostname:
"), username=getpass.getpass("Username: "),
password=getpass.getpass("Password: "))
# Load the example dataset.
load_example_data("GLM", ["admissions_train"])
```
* Prepare example dataset.
```python
# Create the DataFrame on 'admissions_train' table
>>> admissions_train = DataFrame("admissions_train")
>>> admissions_train
masters   gpa     stats programming  admitted
id
13      no  4.00  Advanced      Novice         1
9       no  3.82  Advanced    Advanced         1
33      no  3.55    Novice      Novice         1
6      yes  3.50  Beginner    Advanced         1
7      yes  2.33    Novice      Novice         1
22     yes  3.46    Novice    Beginner         0

4      yes  3.50  Beginner      Novice         1
```
* Import func module from SQLAlchemy package.
```python
# Import func from SQLAlchemy to use the same for executing
aggregate functions
>>> from sqlalchemy import func
```
* Use the func module to generate a function object "agg_func_".
```python
>>> agg_func_ = func.avg(admissions_train.gpa.expression)
```
  Where:
  * func: sqlalchemy module that is imported.
  * avg: the Vantage function name.
Note:
    The function name is case insensitive.
    You can pass the function name in lowercase (avg), uppercase (AVG) or in mixed
    cases (Avg).
  * admissions_train.gpa.expression: an expression that is passed to the function, specifying the
    column to use for calculating average.
    Where:
    admissions_train: the teradataml DataFrame;
    gpa: a column name of the teradataml DataFrame;
    Together, admissions_train.gpa forms a ColumnExpression (teradataml DataFrame Column).
    expression: a property of teradataml DataFrame column, which is passed as the required
    expression to this function object.
* View the type of the function object "agg_func_".
```python
>>> type(agg_func_)
sqlalchemy.sql.functions.Function
```
* Pass the function object "agg_func_", with other function objects for calculating average value of the
  'admitted' column, to DataFrame.assign() function.
```python
>>> df = admissions_train.assign(True, avg_gpa_=agg_func_,
average_admitted_=func.average(admissions_train.admitted.expression),
ave_admitted_=func.ave(admissions_train.admitted.expression))
>>> print_variables(df, ["avg_gpa_", "average_admitted_", "ave_admitted_"])
Equivalent SQL: select ave(admitted) AS ave_admitted_, average(admitted) AS
average_admitted_, avg(gpa) AS avg_gpa_ from "admissions_train"
************************* DataFrame *********************
ave_admitted_  average_admitted_  avg_gpa_
0           0.65               0.65   3.54175
************************* DataFrame.dtypes *********************
ave_admitted_        float
average_admitted_    float
avg_gpa_             float
'avg_gpa_' Column Type: FLOAT
'average_admitted_' Column Type: FLOAT
'ave_admitted_' Column Type: FLOAT
```
  Note:
    Different function names "AVERAGE" and "AVE" that Vantage offers to calculate average are
    used along with 'avg'.
  Note:
    "print_variables()" is a private function used to display example outputs here. This function uses
    "DataFrame.show_query()" to print the query, "print(dataframe)" to display dataframe content,
    and "DataFrame.dtypes" to display DataFrame column types. This function is not part of the
    teradataml package.

Window aggregation offered by Vantage supports clauses and can be used in teradataml with the help
of SQLAlchemy.
For Window aggregates, one of the major tasks is to specify the window over which aggregate operation
must be performed.
Specifying window in SQL is done by OVER clause, which has following syntax:
```python
OVER([PARTITION BY ...] [ORDER BY ...] [RESET WHEN ...] [ROWS ... |
ROWS BETWEEN ...])
```
With SQLAlchemy, specifying window can be achieved by using the over() function, which has the
following syntax:
```python
over(partition_by = partition_expression, order_by = order_expression, rows =
(p, f))
```
Where:
* partition_expression: column expression to partition the data on.
  For example: df.column_name.expression
* order_expression: column expression to sort the data.
  Sorting can be done in either Ascending or Descending order with NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST.
  For example:
  * Default sorting: df.column_name.expression
  * Ascending Order: df.column_name.expression.asc()
  * Descending Order: df.column_name.expression.desc()
  * With NULLS FIRST - df.column_name.expression.nullsfirst()
  * With NULLS LAST - df.column_name.expression.nullslast()
  * Ascending Order with NULLS LAST - df.column_name.expression.asc().nullslast()
* rows: generates the syntax for 'ROWS BETWEEN'.
  To perform windowed aggregate function over a window using ROWS and ROWS BETWEEN, you
  must use a rows argument that accepts a tuple (p, f). p and f can accept the following values. Each
  value passed to p and f has different meaning or results in different syntax. SQL syntax is generated
  based on these values.
  * Negative Value: indicates a preceding value;
  * Positive Value: indicates a following value;
  * None: unbounded value.
#### Example
This section shows how to specify a window and use Window aggregate functions.
Note:
More examples and details can be found at: pkg_install_location\teradataml\data\notebooks\
```python
sqlalchemy\Teradata Vantage Window Aggregate Functions using SQLAlchemy.ipynb.
```
In this example, you return the first value in column 'gpa', over a window of 3 values preceding the current
row and 1 value following the current row.
* Use the func module to generate a function object "FIRST_VALUE_".
```python
# Example returns by id first gpa in the moving average group.
>>> FIRST_VALUE_ =
func.FIRST_VALUE(admissions_train.gpa.expression).over(order_by=admissions_t
rain.id.expression, rows=(-3, 1))
```
* View the type of the function object "FIRST_VALUE_".
```python
>>> type(FIRST_VALUE_)
sqlalchemy.sql.elements.Over
```
* Pass the function object "FIRST_VALUE_" to DataFrame.assign() function to return the first value in
  column 'gpa'.
```python
>>> fv_gpa_df = admissions_train.assign(FIRST_VALUE_gpa=FIRST_VALUE_)
>>> print_variables(fv_gpa_df, "FIRST_VALUE_gpa")
Equivalent SQL: select id AS id, masters AS masters, gpa AS gpa, stats AS
stats, programming AS programming, admitted AS admitted,
FIRST_VALUE(gpa) OVER (ORDER BY id ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 1
FOLLOWING) AS "FIRST_VALUE_gpa" from "admissions_train"

                                    WHEN"
In addition to these functions, all 23 aggregate functions mentioned in the Aggregate Functions section
are also supported.
To use these aggregate functions as Window aggregates, you must add a window to the same using
over() function from SQLAlchemy, as show cased in the example notebook of Window Aggregates. Refer
to the example for AVG function for details.
For Window Aggregate functions to work, you must specify a window on top of these aggregate functions,
using SQLAlchemy. You can specify the following types of Windows:
* Cumulative / Expanding
* Moving / Rolling
* Remaining / Contracting
* Grouping
All of these types computation can be performed with teradataml.
Examples for the these can be found at: pkg_install_location\teradataml\data\notebooks\
```python
sqlalchemy\Teradata Vantage Window Aggregate Functions using SQLAlchemy.ipynb.
```
Note:
The following Teradata SQL syntax are not supported by SQLAlchemy:
* RESET WHEN clause
* ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
* ROWS value PRECEDING
* ROWS CURRENT ROW
Note:
SQLAlchemy offers range over in Window aggregate, Teradata does not support the same.
For example, "RANGE BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 10 FOLLOWING" is not supported.
## Using SQLAlchemy Clause Element and Expression
teradataml is extended to work with different SQLAlchemy clause elements, expressions and functions.
These can be used in teradataml "DataFrame.assign()" method or as filter expression in slice filter ([]) for
teradataml DataFrame.
This section describes how the SQLAlchemy clause elements, expressions, and functions can be used
with teradataml.
* Using Basic SQLAlchemy ClauseElement and Expression in DataFrame.assign()
* Using Basic SQLAlchemy ClauseElement and Expression for Filtering
### Using Basic SQLAlchemy ClauseElement and Expression
### in DataFrame.assign()
With the help of SQLAlchemy, in teradataml, user not only can run SQL functions, but also can run some
other features that Vantage offers. Basically, user can use SQLAlchemy ClauseElements, representing
select_expression clauses in query.
teradataml can use SQLAlchemy ClauseElements to do following:
* Build a CASE expression on teradataml DataFrame column and select the using DataFrame.assign().
* Cast a teradataml DataFrame column.
* Select distinct values from a teradataml DataFrame Column.
* Extract values from teradataml column, using EXTRACT function.
Refer to example notebook pkg_install_location\teradataml\data\notebooks\sqlalchemy\
```python
teradataml assign() - Using Generic SQLAlchemy ClauseElements (Case, Cast, Extract,
Distinct).ipynb to learn about these.
```
### Using Basic SQLAlchemy ClauseElement and Expression
### for Filtering
Vantage offers various types of clauses in WHERE clause that allows users to filter the results in a table.
With the help of SQLAlchemy ClauseElements and Expression, teradataml can use the following SQL
clauses to filter results in teradataml DataFrame:
* CASE expression
* BETWEEN ... AND ... clause
* IN clause
* NOT IN clause
* LIKE clause
* NOT LIKE clause
* ILIKE clause
* IS NULL
* IS NOT NULL
Refer to example notebook pkg_install_location\teradataml\data\notebooks\sqlalchemy\
```python
